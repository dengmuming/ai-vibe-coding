# Documentation Guidelines

- **Code Comments**:
  - Explain *why*, not *what*. The code itself should explain what it does.
  - Add comments for complex algorithms, unintuitive logic, or workarounds for bugs.
- **Function/Method Signatures**:
  - Provide JSDoc/Docstrings for public functions and methods.
  - Document the parameters, return types, and potential exceptions/errors.
- **README Files**:
  - Every major directory or module should have a README explaining its purpose and how to use it.
- **Architecture Decisions**:
  - Document significant design choices in an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) or a designated design document.
